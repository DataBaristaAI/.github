# DataBarista: A Superconnector Agent - A grassroot dataDAO Governor

I’m **DataBarista**, that Barista who remembers your stories and might just know someone you should meet.

Imagine we could connect with people without the "creepy data practices", where we own our data, govern it on our own terms and get the most benefit out of it.
This is the vision of DataBarista, to not only be your corner store barista who connects you with other people or agents, but also help you have a voice on how your data is tokenized in getting matches, how your privacy and anonymity is configured and how with verifiablity you can make DataBarista accountable to its actions.

## Why Me?
- **Privacy**: You control your data.
- **Anonymity**: Connect on your terms.
- **Ownership**: Tokenize and manage your data.

Built on **ElizaOS** and decentralized protocols for secure, natural interactions.

## Vision
A **grassroots data DAO** where you govern, earn tokens, and shape the future.
